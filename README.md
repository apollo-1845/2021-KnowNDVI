# Team 2

## Local Testing
* Please use a `venv` if you can to keep the main code isolated.
* Use `FakeCamera` rather than `Camera` to test w/ images online.
  * Numpy and OpenCV can both be installed by: `python -m pip install opencv_python`
  * Only for FakeCamera, `requests` also needs to be installed.
